Hi, Iâ€™m Blawnode. I love pixels. â–ˆ

#
### Interests
- Iâ€™m interested a lot in game development, music/chiptune production, pixel art and animation.
  
  I'm also interested in writing, website development, and playing video games.

#
### Education
- Iâ€™m currently learning **computer science** at the Open University.

#
### Looking for
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing, yet. One day, I'd like to make games in groups.

#
### Notable current projects
<p align="center"><img alt="Triple Triangle" src="https://github.com/blawnode/image1/blob/main/ItchLogo.png" height="200"></p>
- I am close to finishing a simple, yet polished, mobile game, made with Unity.
#
### Notable past/finished projects
- A maze generator and solver in Python, using the Pillow module.
- Several game jams. In each, I fulfilled a different role: Unity/Godot Programmer, pixel artist/animator, chiptune musician, or sometimes all of them.

#
### Where I upload my works
[Itch.io](https://blawnode.itch.io/) - I post my games here. Mostly games made in game jams.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/blawnode) - I post mostly pixel art and animation, but occassionally music and game-dev posts too.

[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-987269267) - I sometimes post my music here.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCldotnKAENFMJRmH9esOqxA) - I sometimes post my music here, too.

[Bandcamp](https://blawnode.bandcamp.com/) - I want to post my music here as well.

#
### Software I like
For game development, I often like using _Unity_, but I dabble in _Godot_ as well.
For art, I usually use _Aseprite_, but I sometimes draw on paper, or draw digitally in _GIMP_, with a tablet.
For music, I use either a piano, the DAW _LMMS_, or mostly the chiptune tracker, _FamiTracker_.

#
### Contact
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: No way yet. Maybe I will get back to Discord one day, hopefully.
