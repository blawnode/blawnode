â–ˆâ–ˆ Hi, Iâ€™m Blawnode. I love pixels. â–ˆâ–ˆ

<!--I have a separate LinkedIn profile. To find it, look for my name. I will not put my link here.-->

#
### Interests
- Iâ€™m interested a lot in game development, music/chiptune production, pixel art and animation.
  
  I'm also interested in writing, website development, software development and I used to play video games.

#
### Education
- Iâ€™m currently learning **computer science** B.Sc at a university.
<!--![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)-->
- I love the programming languages C#, Js/React.js and Python, and also occassionally use others, like C++ and C.

#
### Looking for
- Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate on anything, yet. One day, I'd like to make games in teams.

#
### Notable current projects
- [Adrift](https://blawnode.itch.io/adrift) - A small Overcooked-like 2D game. Since May 2022, I have been managing a group of 6 teammates (including myself. Now, we're 3.), to work on our personal jam game, which was made in a limited amount of time.

I am the project manager for the game, and also a Unity programmer and a pixel artist and animator. Even composed a thing or two!

The continuation has started in about the middle of July 2022, and is still ongoing, if slowly.

### Notable past/finished projects
<p align="center"><img alt="Triple Triangle" src="https://github.com/blawnode/image1/blob/main/ItchLogo.png" height="200"></p>

- [Triple Triangle](https://blawnode.itch.io/tripletriangle/) - I have finished a simple, yet polished, casual mobile game, made with Unity.

It's at a beta stage, ready for testing.

I am not concentrating on the project at the moment.

- [Several game jams](https://blawnode.itch.io/). In each, I fulfilled a different role: Unity/Godot Programmer, pixel artist/animator, chiptune musician, or sometimes all of them.

- A great one is Adrift - its first version, that is.

At first, it was a 5 day game jam I've managed, with only a single 6-peep team making a game together.

We tried making this 2D pixel game with Unreal Engine 5. This was funny.

- Another noteworthy example is <b>[The Cackler](https://github.com/blawnode/EverhoodCackler)</b> - A submission to an unconventional game jam. I had a month to make a custom battle for Everhood.

While I won utterly nothing, I love the result. I made the battle alone: the art, the music (fully original) and the programming. Link and image are due.

  <!-- TODO: Add a download link to the actual battle, show a video, and a few (one?) preview GIFs. More presentability! -->

### Software I like

![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/GODOT-%23FFFFFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=godot-engine)-->
For game development, I often like using _Unity_, but I dabble in _Godot_ as well.

For art, I usually use _Aseprite_, but I sometimes draw on paper, or draw digitally in _GIMP_, with a tablet.

For music, I use either a piano, the DAW _LMMS_, or mostly the chiptune tracker, _FamiTracker_.
